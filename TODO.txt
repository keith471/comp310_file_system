Write a function that takes the nth block of a file and returns the block_no for that block!
Then, for read:
- Figure out the first block to read
- figure out the last block to read by adding length to rwpointer
- allocate a buffer with size char my_buf[(last_block - first_block + 1)*BLOCK_SZ]
- iterate over this range of blocks, getting the block_no and reading that block into my_buf
- at the end of it all, perform a memcpy(buf, mybuf + (rwptr % BLOCK_SZ), length)

Data structures we need:
1. inodes
 - inode struct
 - inode table = array of inode structs of length # inodes available on disk
 - initially, all entries in the array are uninitialized except for the first, which is for the root directory

 2. root directory
  - directory entry struct = struct containing the fields necessary for an entry in the directory
  - directory table = array containing directory entries
  - must be initialized with size = ???????????????????????

3. super block
 - a struct with all super block fields
 - write this to the first block on disk - easy

4. free bit max
 - contains one bit per block on disk
 - 1 indicates the block is free, 0 used

5. file descriptor table
 - index into table = file descriptor = fileID
 - table entry contains a struct with two fields:
    - rwpointer = the byte within the given file at which to begin reading or writing
    - inode number = the index of the inode table in which the inode for the given file is stored

Upon fresh start up, we initialize an empty root directory table, an empty file descriptor table,
an empty inode table, some datastructure to keep track of what inodes are in use and which aren't,
a bit map with all ones, and a superblock.

We generate an inode for the root directory and add it to the inode table.
The root directory will have zero size to begin with so we need not write any blocks for it.
As files are added to the system, we create directory_entrys, add them to the directory_table,
and write the new directory entries to disk, increasing the size of the root directory. Thus, we
will need to modify the inode for root directory in the inode table, and rewrite the inode to disk.
Summary for adding a new file:
1. Create a new directory entry
2. Add it to the directory table
3. Modify the inode for the root directory in the inode table
4. Rewrite the inode table to disk
5. Rewrite the directory table to disk

We write the superblock to the first block on disk,
then the inode table to the next blocks, then the bit map to the next blocks.

When you need to read the value of an indirect pointer, just read the entire block of indirect pointers into an array
indirect_ptrs[BLOCK_SZ/4] and then index into the array to get the ptr you need.
