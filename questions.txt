- what is size field of inode? Bytes or blocks?
- clang: error: cannot specify -o when generating multiple output files
- why +1 in NUM_INODE_BLOCKS? (sfs_api.c)
- Don't need to worry about multiple processes accessing the same file at the same time?
Then we'd need to search the fd table for the file being opened and make sure it's not already open.
If already open, we'd have to return the fd of the existing entry so that both processes point to the
same fd entry.


Free bit map
let 1 represent free, 0 used

ffs c function can determine if a block has been used

force_set_index -> one liner with the USE_BIT macro


For testing fuse wrapper
echo "some stuff" > out.txt
ls // should work
echo "stuff" >> out.txt
